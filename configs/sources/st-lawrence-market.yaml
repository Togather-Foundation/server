# Disabled — stlawrencemarket.com redirects (302) to www.stlawrencemarket.com/events/
# which redirects again; scraper does not follow redirects. Final events page uses
# a simple div.event_list which was empty on inspection — events may be dynamically loaded.
# notes: Redirect chain blocks scraper; events likely JS-rendered. Needs Tier 2.
