# Disabled — concert season page is a static WordPress editorial page (not a listing).
# Concerts are described in Gutenberg blocks (wp-block-columns) without structured
# repeating containers; no JSON-LD Events and no parseable CSS selector pattern.
# notes: Custom static season page, no tribe_events or repeating card structure.
#        Would need Tier 2 (headless) or a custom parser to extract from freeform HTML.
