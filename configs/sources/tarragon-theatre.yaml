# Organization match: no match found in database
# Note: Images are lazy-loaded (data-src); the src attribute returns a placeholder SVG.
# No per-item dates on the listing page — dates are on detail pages only.
# Events will be skipped by the normaliser (startDate required); this config provides
# URL/name discovery only. A Tier 2 follow-up scraper on detail pages could extract dates.
# URLs point to /plays/ paths (season productions), not /events/.
