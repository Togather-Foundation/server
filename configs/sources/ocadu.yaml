# Tier 1 (Colly CSS selectors). Drupal calendar view, 328 raw rows confirmed 2026-02-21.
# Calendar repeats events per day — use max_pages: 1 to limit duplication.
# No startDate: date is on the parent <td> (calendar day wrapper), not on the <li> row.
# Tier-1 selectors can't reach a parent element; needs tier-2 detail-page scraping or
# a structural change to the selector approach to extract dates.
