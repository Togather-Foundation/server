# Tier 1 (Colly CSS selectors). Festival homepage ticketed shows, 4 events confirmed 2026-02-21.
# Off-season count is low; spikes during festival (June).
# No startDate: partial dates ("June 23") present in HTML but lack year — normaliser rejects them.
# Needs tier-2 detail-page scraping or a date-normalisation improvement for year-less strings.
