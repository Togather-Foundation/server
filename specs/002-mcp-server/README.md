# MCP Server for Togather API - Quick Start

This directory contains the specification and implementation plan for adding Model Context Protocol (MCP) support to the Togather SEL API.

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, custom agents) to interact with external systems through:
- **Tools**: Functions the agent can call (e.g., `create_event`, `list_places`)
- **Resources**: Read-only data the agent can access (e.g., JSON-LD contexts, API schemas)
- **Prompts**: Templates for common tasks (e.g., "parse natural language into structured event")

Think of it as a "USB-C port for AI" - a standardized way to connect AI applications to your API.

## Implementation Status

**Branch**: `002-mcp-server`  
**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE - Ready for merge consideration  
**Completion Date**: 2026-02-06

### Implementation Summary

#### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (20 beads)
- **Completed**: 2026-02-05
- **Beads**: server-66za through server-2r4z
- **Phases**: 9 (Dependency Setup → Documentation)
- All 10 tools implemented and functional
- All 3 transports (stdio, SSE, HTTP) operational
- Resources and prompts fully integrated

#### Phase 2: Code Review & Quality Improvements (~20 beads)
- **Completed**: 2026-02-06
- **Focus**: SEL compliance, Go idioms, concurrency safety, test coverage
- All P0 (critical) issues resolved
- All P1 (high priority) issues resolved
- All P2 (medium priority) issues resolved
- Only P3 (low priority) documentation tasks remain

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Unit + integration tests added
- **SEL Compliance**: Verified against constitution requirements
- **Code Quality**: Linting, error handling, concurrency patterns reviewed
- **Documentation**: API documentation, usage examples, integration guides complete
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (only touches `go.mod`, new directories)

## Features

### Tools (10 total)
| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `list_events` | Search/filter events | ✅ Implemented |
| `get_event` | Get single event | ✅ Implemented |
| `create_event` | Create new event | ✅ Implemented |
| `list_places` | Search/filter places | ✅ Implemented |
| `get_place` | Get single place | ✅ Implemented |
| `create_place` | Create new place | ✅ Implemented |
| `list_organizations` | Search/filter orgs | ✅ Implemented |
| `get_organization` | Get single org | ✅ Implemented |
| `create_organization` | Create new org | ✅ Implemented |
| `search` | Cross-entity search | ✅ Implemented |

### Resources (5 total)
- `context://sel-event` - Event JSON-LD context
- `context://sel-place` - Place JSON-LD context
- `context://sel-organization` - Organization JSON-LD context
- `schema://openapi` - Complete OpenAPI spec
- `info://server` - Server version and capabilities

### Prompts (3 total)
- `create_event_from_text` - Parse natural language event descriptions
- `find_venue` - Find suitable venues
- `duplicate_check` - Check for existing events

### Transports (3 modes)
- **stdio**: For Claude Desktop, spawned agent processes
- **SSE**: For simple web deployments
- **Streamable HTTP**: For production web services

## Parallel Development Workflow

### Why This Works
The MCP server implementation is **additive** - it creates new directories and files without modifying existing API code (except for `go.mod` and optionally `router.go`). This means:

✅ **Safe**: Won't break existing API functionality  
✅ **Isolated**: Minimal merge conflicts  
✅ **Testable**: Can run both servers simultaneously  
✅ **Incremental**: Can merge anytime without blocking other work

### Multi-Branch Development with OpenCode

You can work on MCP server in one terminal while working on other features in another:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - MCP Server Development
cd /path/to/togather/server
git checkout -b 002-mcp-server
# Work on MCP beads (server-66za, server-b33c, etc.)

# Terminal 2 - Other Feature Development  
cd /path/to/togather/server
git checkout main  # or another feature branch
# Work on other beads
```

**Key Points:**
- Each terminal/OpenCode instance tracks its own beads independently
- Use `bd dolt push` regularly to push bead state to git
- The 002-mcp-server branch is additive, so merge conflicts are minimal
- Beads are tracked per-branch via git commit metadata

### Getting Started

Use the standalone MCP server binary or enable the `/mcp` endpoint on the main server.

## Documentation

- **[plan.md](./plan.md)** - Complete implementation plan with phases, architecture, decisions
- **[spec.md](./spec.md)** - Detailed specification (to be created)
- **MCP Protocol Docs**: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs
- **mcp-go Library**: https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go

## Beads Workflow

All MCP work is tracked in beads. View MCP-related beads:

```bash
# List all MCP beads
bd query 'title~"mcp" AND status=open'

# Show bead details
bd show server-66za

# Check what's ready to work
bd ready

# Work on a bead
bd update server-66za --status in_progress
# ... do work ...
bd close server-66za --reason "Added mcp-go dependency and verified compatibility"
bd dolt push
```

## Dependencies

### Beads Summary

All MCP beads have been completed. See `bd query 'title~"mcp" AND status=closed'` for full history.
