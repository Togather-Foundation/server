Review enum types and check constraints\n\n2. **Migration Safety**:\n   - Verify migrations are idempotent and reversible\n   - Check for destructive operations (DROP, ALTER with data loss)\n   - Validate migration order and dependencies\n   - Test rollback scenarios for recent migrations\n   - Ensure no data loss paths\n\n3. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Review unique constraints (ULIDs, dedup_hash, federation_uri)\n   - Check cascade delete behavior\n   - Validate timestamp defaults (created_at, updated_at)\n   - Review soft delete implementation (deleted_at nullable)\n   - Check for orphaned record prevention\n\n4. **Performance**:\n   - Review 000007_performance_indexes.up.sql\n   -

000001_core.up.sql: Core tables (events, places, orgs, occurrences, series)\n  - 000002_provenance.up.sql: Source tracking, field provenance\n  - 000003_federation.up.sql: Federation nodes, event changes, tombstones\n  -

Foreign keys (organizer_id, venue_id, series_id, origin_node_id)\n  - Unique constraints (ulid, dedup_hash, federation_uri)\n  - Full-text search (GIN indexes with tsvector)\n  - Trigram similarity (pg_trgm for fuzzy matching)\n  - Geospatial queries (PostGIS GIST indexes)\n  - Time-range queries (start_time, end_time composite indexes)\n  - Partial indexes for soft deletes, federation sync\n✅ **Extensions**: pgcrypto, pg_trgm, postgis properly initialized\n✅ **Triggers**: Tombstone→event_changes trigger for federation sync\n✅ **Views**: field_conflicts view for provenance resolution\n✅ **Check Constraints**: Enum validation, range checks (confidence 0-1, price_min≤price_max)\n✅ **Location Validation**: `event_location_required` constraint (venue OR virtual_url)\n✅ **Migration Safety**: All migrations are reversible (down scripts present)\n\n## Performance Analysis\n✅ Indexes cover common query patterns:\n  - Event lookups by ULID: `UNIQUE` index on ulid\n  - Deduplication queries: `idx_events_dedup` (WHERE lifecycle_state NOT IN deleted)\n  - Federation sync: `idx_events_federation` (origin_node_id, federation_uri)\n  - Time-range queries: `idx_occurrences_time_range` (start_time, end_time)\n  - Geographic queries: `idx_places_geo` (GIST on geo_point)\n  - Full-text search: `idx_events_search_vector`, `idx_places_search` (GIN tsvector)\n  - Change feed pagination: `idx_event_changes_sequence` (UNIQUE BIGSERIAL)\n✅ Partial indexes reduce size: deleted events, federated events, published events\n✅ Composite indexes match JOIN patterns: (event_id, start_time), (venue_id, start_time)\n✅ JSONB GIN indexes for snapshot queries\n\n## Issues Found\n**NONE** - No schema issues or data integrity problems found.\n\n## Recommendations (Optional Enhancements - Low Priority)\n1. **Consider adding index on `users.email`**: Login queries use `GetUserByUsername` but email is also UNIQUE. If email-based login is added, index would help.\n2. **Consider composite index on `events(lifecycle_state, published_at)`**: Common query pattern for published events ordered by date.\n3. **Monitor `event_changes` table growth**: BIGSERIAL sequence can handle billions of rows, but table may grow large. Consider archival strategy for old changes.\n4. **Consider VACUUM/ANALYZE schedule**: For large datasets, regular maintenance improves query planner statistics.\n\n## Deployment Readiness\n**PASS** - Schema is production-ready.\n\nThe database design demonstrates:\n- Strong data modeling principles\n- Comprehensive indexing strategy\n- Proper data integrity constraints\n- Safe migration practices\n- Performance optimization\n- Federation-first architecture\n\n**No blocking issues found.**"}
