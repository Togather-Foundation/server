{"id":"srv-2c3","title":"Add transaction support for batch ingestion","description":"BatchIngestionWorker processes events without explicit transaction boundaries. However, River's retry mechanism provides eventual consistency:\n\n**Current Behavior:**\n1. Events are ingested one-by-one (each with its own transaction in IngestService)\n2. Results are stored in batch_ingestion_results table\n3. If results storage fails, River retries the entire job\n4. On retry, events are detected as duplicates (dedup hash) and marked accordingly\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Individual event ingestion is already transactional (IngestService handles this)\n- Batch results storage failure triggers job retry (River mechanism)\n- Duplicate detection ensures idempotency on retry\n- This provides eventual consistency without requiring a single large transaction\n\n**Decision:** WONTFIX - Current implementation is sound\n- Wrapping all events in a single transaction would:\n  1. Hold locks for longer (100 events = long transaction)\n  2. Risk deadlocks with concurrent ingestion\n  3.

Test rollback scenarios for recent migrations\n   - Ensure no data loss paths\n\n3. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Review unique constraints (ULIDs, dedup_hash, federation_uri)\n   - Check cascade delete behavior\n   - Validate timestamp defaults (created_at, updated_at)\n   - Review soft delete implementation (deleted_at nullable)\n   - Check for orphaned record prevention\n\n4. **Performance**:\n   - Review 000007_performance_indexes.up.sql\n   -

Foreign keys (organizer_id, venue_id, series_id, origin_node_id)\n  - Unique constraints (ulid, dedup_hash, federation_uri)\n  - Full-text search (GIN indexes with tsvector)\n  - Trigram similarity (pg_trgm for fuzzy matching)\n  - Geospatial queries (PostGIS GIST indexes)\n  - Time-range queries (start_time, end_time composite indexes)\n  - Partial indexes for soft deletes, federation sync\n✅ **Extensions**: pgcrypto, pg_trgm, postgis properly initialized\n✅ **Triggers**: Tombstone→event_changes trigger for federation sync\n✅ **Views**: field_conflicts view for provenance resolution\n✅ **Check Constraints**: Enum validation, range checks (confidence 0-1, price_min≤price_max)\n✅ **Location Validation**: `event_location_required` constraint (venue OR virtual_url)\n✅ **Migration Safety**: All migrations are reversible (down scripts present)\n\n## Performance Analysis\n✅ Indexes cover common query patterns:\n  - Event lookups by ULID: `UNIQUE` index on ulid\n  - Deduplication queries: `idx_events_dedup` (WHERE lifecycle_state NOT IN deleted)\n  - Federation sync: `idx_events_federation` (origin_node_id, federation_uri)\n  - Time-range queries: `idx_occurrences_time_range` (start_time, end_time)\n  - Geographic queries: `idx_places_geo` (GIST on geo_point)\n  - Full-text search: `idx_events_search_vector`, `idx_places_search` (GIN tsvector)\n  - Change feed pagination: `idx_event_changes_sequence` (UNIQUE BIGSERIAL)\n✅ Partial indexes reduce size: deleted events, federated events, published events\n✅ Composite indexes match JOIN patterns: (event_id, start_time), (venue_id, start_time)\n✅ JSONB GIN indexes for snapshot queries\n\n## Issues Found\n**NONE** - No schema issues or data integrity problems found.\n\n## Recommendations (Optional Enhancements - Low Priority)\n1. **Consider adding index on `users.email`**: Login queries use `GetUserByUsername` but email is also UNIQUE. If email-based login is added, index would help.\n2. **Consider composite index on `events(lifecycle_state, published_at)`**: Common query pattern for published events ordered by date.\n3. **Monitor `event_changes` table growth**: BIGSERIAL sequence can handle billions of rows, but table may grow large. Consider archival strategy for old changes.\n4. **Consider VACUUM/ANALYZE schedule**: For large datasets, regular maintenance improves query planner statistics.\n\n## Deployment Readiness\n**PASS** - Schema is production-ready.\n\nThe database design demonstrates:\n- Strong data modeling principles\n- Comprehensive indexing strategy\n- Proper data integrity constraints\n- Safe migration practices\n- Performance optimization\n- Federation-first architecture\n\n**No blocking issues found.**"}

{"id":"srv-l85","title":"Bug: Caddy reload not taking effect after blue-green deployment","description":"## Problem\nAfter successful blue-green deployment, traffic continued routing to old (green) slot even though:\n- New version deployed to blue slot successfully\n- Caddyfile configuration updated to point to blue slot (localhost:8081)\n- Deployment logs showed 'Switching traffic to blue slot' and 'Traffic already pointing to blue slot'\n- But actual HTTP responses showed 'x-togather-slot: green' header\n\n## What Fixed It\nManual Caddy reload: `sudo systemctl reload caddy`\nAfter this, traffic correctly routed to blue slot with new version.\n\n## Investigation Needed\n\n### 1. Deployment Script Behavior\nLocation: deploy/scripts/deploy.sh (line 1655 calls switch_traffic)\nFunction: switch_traffic() at line 1315\n\nThe script claims to reload Caddy, but it's not taking effect. Possible causes:\n- Caddy reload command not waiting for completion\n- Race condition in systemd reload\n- Caddy caching old config\n- Timing issue between config write and reload\n\n### 2. Evidence from Deployment (d7d9477)\nDeployment log: .agent-output/1770742238-1757016/.-deploy-scripts-deploy.sh-staging---version-HEAD-20260210-115038.log\n\nKey log lines:\n- Line 29: 'HEAD is now at d7d9477 fix(review-queue): Add missing cursor variable declaration'\n- Logs showed: 'Switching traffic to blue slot'\n- Logs showed: 'Traffic already pointing to blue slot'\n- BUT: curl showed x-togather-slot: green\n\n### 3. Docker Container State\nAt time of issue:\n```\ntogather-server-blue   togather-server:d7d9477   Up 51 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8081-\u003e8080/tcp\ntogather-server-green  togather-server:69be857   Up 2 hours (healthy)      0.0.0.0:8082-\u003e8080/tcp\n```\n\nCaddyfile configuration (confirmed with sudo cat /etc/caddy/Caddyfile):\n```\nreverse_proxy localhost:8081 {  # Points to blue slot\n```\n\nBut traffic going to green (8082) until manual reload.\n\n### 4. Caddy Service State\n```\nsystemctl status caddy\nActive: active (running) since Mon 2026-02-02 22:08:32 UTC; 1 week 0 days ago\nProcess: 3558449 ExecReload=/usr/bin/caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --force\n```\n\nLast reload shown in status was old - suggests reload command during deployment didn't register.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n1. Deploy new version: `./deploy/scripts/deploy.sh staging --version HEAD`\n2. Wait for 'SUCCESS' message\n3. Check version: `curl https://staging.toronto.togather.foundation/version`\n4. Check slot: `curl -I https://staging.toronto.togather.foundation/health | grep slot`\n5. If slot doesn't match Caddyfile, reload needed\n\n## Impact\n- Zero-downtime deployments don't actually switch traffic\n- New versions deployed but not serving traffic\n- Manual intervention required (sudo access)\n- Users see stale version despite successful deployment\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- deploy/scripts/deploy.sh (switch_traffic function, line 1315)\n- deploy/config/environments/Caddyfile.staging\n- Caddy systemd service configuration\n- Any Caddy reload timing/sync issues\n\n## Questions\n1. Does switch_traffic() wait for Caddy reload to complete?\n2. Is there a race condition with systemd ExecReload?\n3. Should we verify traffic switched before declaring success?\n4. Should deployment script check x-togather-slot header post-deploy?\n5. Is Caddy caching config despite reload?\n\n## Workaround\nAfter any deployment to staging, manually run:\n```bash\nssh togather 'sudo systemctl reload caddy'\n```\n\nThen verify:\n```bash\ncurl -I https://staging.toronto.togather.foundation/health | grep slot\ncurl https://staging.toronto.togather.foundation/version\n```\n\n## Related\n- Blue-green deployment spec: specs/001-deployment-infrastructure/spec.md\n- Caddy architecture: deploy/CADDY-ARCHITECTURE.md","notes":"## Root Cause\n\nTwo bugs working together:\n\n### Bug 1: Caddyfile sync overwrites live port (PRIMARY)\nThe sync at deploy.sh:1337-1341 copies the repo Caddyfile (hardcoded to port 8081/blue) over the live /etc/caddy/Caddyfile without preserving the active port/slot. This only triggers when the repo Caddyfile has structural changes (new headers, Grafana config, etc.) — explaining the intermittent nature.\n\n### Bug 2: Early return skips verification and reload (SECONDARY)  \nAfter the sync overwrites the file, the port check at line 1366 reads from the just-overwritten file and sees port 8081 (matching the target), so it returns 0 without reloading Caddy or verifying traffic. Caddy's in-memory config still routes to the old slot.\n\n### Bug 3: systemctl reload is asynchronous\nsystemctl reload sends SIGUSR1 to Caddy and returns immediately, before the config is applied. This creates a race window where verification can pass against the old config.\n\n## Fix Applied\n1. Caddyfile sync now preserves live port/slot before overwriting from repo\n2. Removed early return — version verification always runs\n3. Switched to caddy reload --config --force (admin API, synchronous) with systemctl fallback\n4.

{"id":"srv-zqh","title":"Support full schema.org Event ingestion format","description":"Currently our EventInput format differs from standard schema.org Event structure. We should accept standard schema.org JSON-LD Events to enable easier ingestion from external sources like Toronto Open Data.\n\nKey differences:\n1. Address structure: schema.org uses nested location.address.streetAddress vs our flat location.streetAddress\n2. Geo coordinates: schema.org uses location.geo.latitude/longitude vs our flat location.latitude/longitude  \n3. Organization fields: schema.org organizer can have email/telephone which we don't capture\n4. Offers structure: schema.org uses offers.price (number) vs our offers.price (string)\n5. Missing @context handling: We should accept and normalize schema.org @context\n\nSee docs/interop/CORE_PROFILE_v0.1.md and API_CONTRACT_v1.md for SEL canonical format.\n\nExample Toronto event: https://civictechto.github.io/toronto-opendata-festivalsandevents-jsonld-proxy/all.jsonld\n\nThis aligns with SEL principle: 'Schema.org First' from Core Interop Profile.","notes":"✓ URL Normalization Complete:\n- Adds https:// to www. prefixed URLs and bare domains\n- Preserves mailto: and existing protocols\n- Handles @mentions gracefully (preserves for validation)\n- Applied to all URL fields throughout EventInput\n- Comprehensive test coverage (25+ test cases)\n- Social media platform support (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Eventbrite)\n\nDeployed to staging (b3dfa53, 4c44927), tested with Toronto Open Data.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL QUESTION BEFORE PROCEEDING:\nWhy aren't we already using schema.org format natively as our EventInput?\n- The SEL principle is 'Schema.org First' (Core Interop Profile)\n- Our EventInput already closely mirrors schema.org Event\n- We're adding normalization to bridge the gap, but should we just BE schema.org?\n\nNeed to investigate:\n1. Review original design decision for EventInput vs schema.org Event\n2. Check if there are SEL-specific extensions that prevent direct schema.org use\n3. Evaluate: Should EventInput BE schema.org Event with SEL extensions?\n4. Or: Should we have a transformation layer that accepts schema.org and converts to SEL canonical?\n\nRemaining work (IF we proceed with current approach):\n1. Address structure normalization (nested vs flat)\n2. Geo coordinates normalization (nested vs flat)\n3. Organization email/telephone capture\n4. Offers price type handling (number vs string)\n5. @context handling and transformation","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"ryan.kelln@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T09:02:32.405747278-05:00","created_by":"Ryan Kelln","updated_at":"2026-02-07T20:41:13.162030493-05:00"}
